        Cats are wonderful pets. They are very cute and sweet and very gentle too. I have many friends who have cats as their pets. Cats are bubbly and lively too.
        I also have a cat as my pet and I love her very much. I have named my little pet cat as Lilly. She came home when she was a kitten. I still remember,
        she could not even open her eyes. We fed her milk and took good care of her. Made her a warm bed to sleep and a little bowl for her to have milk.
        When she started to grow, we trained her for her toiletry habits and on playing with us. She is a very intelligent cat and understands very fast what we tell her.
        She is now big and walks across the lawn with all the pride that she could.
        She plays with us and her favourite place would be on het mat, near the fire place in our home. She loves to be in a warm and cozy place. We have tied a small bell around her neck and so we know where she would be. She also loves the bell.
        We feed her with milk and fish bones and other food items. She loves when we have something special made for her. She roams around lazily, but when there is a need, she is very alert and attentive. She is also a wonderful cleaner of other insects in the house. She loves to play with other cats in the neighbourhood.
